Welcome to my project and personal portfolio! This site is currently a work in progress.

# Active Projects
- OpenPrompter Software (OPS): an easily customizable and 
  scalable teleprompting solution, which is free software and easy to deploy.
  Check it out [here](https://github.com/amyipdev/openprompter-beta).
- The Extendable Assembler Library (libxas): an extendable library for
  assembly and binary utilities, designed to be easy to port to any platform
  and format. With a fast Bell-style parser, libxas is a great solution
  for your toolchain development needs. Check it out [here](https://github.com/amyipdev/libxas).

# About Me

I'm Amy, a computer science major at Cerritos College. My focuses are
on systems and utilities programming, with emphases on UNIX-like systems.
I also work in philosophical writing and advocacy, being the Director of
Equity and Diversity for the Associated Students of Cerritos College this year
and the Deputy last year.

# Hobbies
- Programming/software development
- Reading and writing (currently working through [*Settlers*](https://readsettlers.org) by J. Sakai)
- Advocacy (see my [ASCC Legislation](https://www.cerritos.edu/activities/meetings/ASCC-Legislation.htm), "Joint Legislations and Resolutions")
- Public transportation
  - Ever since the passage of [SB-2122-03](https://www.cerritos.edu/activities/_includes/docs/1_Approved_Legislation/SB-2122-03_Signed_ua.pdf), 
    I've been able to ride most public transit within LA County for free. Because of this, I've become somewhat of a
    public transportation nerd, and I enjoy riding it as a hobby.
- Supporting [software](https://fsf.org) and [internet](https://eff.org) freedom
- Working with various \*NIX systems
  - I currently use Fedora Linux on all of my daily-driver systems, and Debian on my servers.
  - I work a lot with FreeBSD, LFS, and Arch Linux; I intend to eventually switch my daily drivers over to a well-built Arch configuration.
